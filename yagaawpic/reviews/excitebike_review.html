Excitebike is another one of those Nintendo-made games commonly
associated with the NES. It was one of the first motorcross racing
games way back in the day, and it's still a fun game, even over twenty
years later.<br>
<br>
So, you know, it's bike racing, so the premise is straightforward:
race. You can either play in Mode A or Mode B; in A you just kinda race
by yourself, but Mode B is an actual race. In either one however, your
ultimate goal is to beat the clock. You gotta finish in the top three
to progress thru the game's five tracks. This isn't too difficult,
although it's not so easy that you'll get it on your first try. Mode B
presents more difficulty, and thus I prefer this mode. Why race alone
anyways?<br>
<br>
The tracks are split into four lanes which you switch between using the
D-Pad. You've got your throttle on the A button, and a Turbo on the B
button. Using Turbo for too long causes your engine to overheat however.<br>
<br>
The tracks are also filled with plenty of obstacles, such as missing
pieces of track, pits, small barricades, and ramps. The ramps are the
biggest part of the game. While in midair you have to balance yourself
out so you land on both wheels and keep your speed up. Pulling back on
your bike (ie left on the D-Pad) is also one way I've found to gain
speed as you come off a ramp.<br>
<br>
You can also interfere with other racers by getting in front of them,
causing them to fall off their bike. This can happen to you as well
though, and the AI makes sure of it. Speaking of AI, it works pretty
well in this game. It's a simple game, so it doesn't call for much
really, but it tries to trick you here and there. For example,
sometimes the track thins out to just two lanes. When you close in on
another biker, they may start swerving up and down the two lanes,
keeping both sides covered. Then again, the racing AI just likes to
swerve all over the place anyway.<br>
<br>
On nice bonus to the Excitebike package is a track editor. The game
gives you the twenty-some pieces and piece combos seen in the main
game's five tracks. It's pretty cool that there was an actual level
editor in this game, but you can't save your designs (which is
understandable anyway - although the Famicom Disk version did have a
save-to-disk feature).<br>
<br>
Graphics and sound wise, the game is great. The visuals look clean, and
the tracks look clean as well. Music is there, although there's no BGM
music during actual gameplay, just the roar of engines (which is still
plenty passable).<br>
<br>
The game's an easy find on eBay and in some game stores, so if you have
an NES and you don't have this game, you should have this game.
