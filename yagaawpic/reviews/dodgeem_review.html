Dodge 'Em joins the ranks of the many other maze/dot-eating games on
the 2600, although this one is a lot less like that.<br>
<br>
The basic concept in Dodge 'Em is that you have to drive your car
around a four -layered circut, driving over dots. There are four breaks
in the circuts, where you can change lanes. But then there's this other
car, and it drives in the opposite direction. So that's where changing
lanes is key, because you have to switch out of the one the other car
may pull into. Because the outer lane is the largest, you seem to crash
a lot in that one, because the COM can pull into it and you're
basically dead.<br>
<br>
It's a pretty thrilling game, especially when you get down to the last
few lanes. The COM likes to drive through those especially, to keep you
out of 'em. Thankfully, you have another way to combat the COM in the
form of a boost triggered by using the fire button. It allows you to
quickly zip into lanes to beat out the COM, who always seems to find
ways to screw you over.<br>
<br>
So basically, you go through the game, level after level. It gets a bit
faster and a bit harder each time. One thing I find annoying is that I
constantly have to reach to reset the console; you only get three lives
when you play, and you lose them fast.<br>
<br>
Well.... at least I do. --_--<br>
<br>
The game is essentially just the one player and an additional two
player mode, where you trade off with someone else being the
dot-collecting car and the "crash" car.<br>
<br>
For the Atari, the graphics are pretty plain. It's just blue walls on a
black background with kinda blocky cars. But hey, for the purposes of
the game, they work fine.<br>
<br>
Sound? You've got the humming of the cars, and a crash sound you soon
become all too familiar with. There's also an official "lane-changing"
sound effect.<br>
<br>
Although the game looks plain, it can't be underestimated.  It's a great game for one or two players.
