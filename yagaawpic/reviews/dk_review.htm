Donkey Kong is, as we all know, the Nintendo arcade classic that marked
Mario's (er, Jumpman's) first video game appearence. This game has been
ported to many home consoles, including the NES, C64, and many Atari
systems, including the 2600. In the end, there are other, better ports
of this arcade classic, but this one is passable.<br>
<br>
Once you've fired up the game and played it for a while, the first, and
most glaring omission you'll notice is a lack of two screens. So the
game is only two screens long! It's a bit of a dissappointment,
although it's hard to tell whether it was simply due to the limited
space of an Atari cart, or just some sort of development-side issue.
Either way, this is the one thing that makes the 2600 version of Donkey
Kong stand out from the rest of 'em.<br>
<br>
The game's two levels - as you might guess - are the first and last.
The first level has you scaling a factory to reach the ape DK and
Mario's girlfriend, while climbing ladders and hopping barrels. The
game is still very faithful to the original arcade game.<br>
<br>
The second level is a five-tiered complex. Deadly fireballs roam each
level of this screen. On each level are two platforms, which when run
over are destroyed. So your goal is to destroy eight of these chunks of
the platform. Once you do that you've beaten the level. Missing from
the 2600 port of DK is the end cutscene, where the platforms rip apart
and Mario is reunited with his girlfriend and all that good stuff.
Chances are you won't care though.<br>
<br>
And of course in each screen is your good friend and mine the hammer.
The hammer works... well, it works like the hammer from the Donkey Kong
arcade game. And that's a good thing, especially considering [ I belive
it's] the Intellevision version of DK had a messed-up hammer or
something.<br>
<br>
The graphics obviously look nothing like the arcade game, but hey, what
can you expect? It's the Twenty-Six-Hundred. Still, Mario looks like
Mario, and Donkey Kong looks like Donkey Kong. Mario also animates well.<br>
<br>
The sound effects are a bit sparse, limited to only the walking of
Mario and the jumping sound. Although, they did manage to get that
classic "dooloodoo do doo" sound effect from jumping over the barrels
down right.<br>
<br>
So, in the end, if you want to play Donkey Kong, you could do better than this version, but what it does do it does well.
