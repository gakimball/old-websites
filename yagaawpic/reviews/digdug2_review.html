Enter Dig Dug II, the sequel to the most-awesome arcade game Dig Dug.
The sequel isn't what you might expect, it doesn't actually recycle
much besides graphics from the first game; it's a completely new Dig
Dug experience, albeit one that isn't as much fun.<br>
<br>
The core concept is half there: kill every enemy to beat a level. But,
instead of tunneling underground to find his enemies, our nameless hero
finds himself in a top-down perspective on a multitude of islands. He's
still armed with his famous pump, with which he inflates the game's two
resident enemies - the round red guy Pooka and the fire-breathing
Frygar - to the point of popping. But, the little white guy has some
new tricks up his sleeve, namely in the form of a jackhammer.<br>
<br>
Each island will have small holes in the ground. By drilling into these
holes, he can make splits in the ground in any of four directions.
Thus, by making creases that form a circut, entire chunks of the island
will break off, taking any enemies, or even Dig Dug, into the drink
with it. It's an interesting concept, and sometimes the game will pull
a fast one on you and almost send you into the ocean.<br>
<br>
Now let me get nitpicky about the controls: you can only move in four
directions, which I find to be a handicap of sorts; and as you're
inflating enemies, you can't just mash on the A button, as there's
about a half-second delay between each "allowed" press of the A button.
After playing the first Dig Dug a lot on one of those Namco joysticks,
this mechanism makes defeating enemies a lot slower.<br>
<br>
Graphically, the game hasn't changed too much. The enemy sprites look
the same, although Dig Dug has been updated to suit the game's top-down
view. There's also a new soundtrack, which is one song; but it isn't
like in the first Dig Dug, where the music only played as you moved.
Although this certainly isn't a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Several slight gameplay flaws aside, it was a pretty solid buy for two bucks, as opposed to the standard of five I see at my EB.
