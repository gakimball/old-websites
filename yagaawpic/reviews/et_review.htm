Never play this game. I don't care how much you got it for, people have
died playing this game. It actually lowers the life span of those who
play it.<br>
<br>
Alright, so, uh, exxagerations aside, this game sucks. I've played some
bad games, but this is just awful. Not only is it boring, poorly
thought out, rushed, and repetitive, it's also _impossible_ to beat!<br>
<br>
So here's how it works. Some flying elevator drops ET off on Earth. Now
he needs to find the parts of his phone so he can... here it comes...
phone home. Although I'm assuming what dropped him off is a spaceship,
he now has to phone his ship again? Odd.<br>
<br>
So, to construct this fancy alien phone, you have to find the
who-knows-how-many parts to it. And where are these parts to be found?<br>
<br>
Pits.<br>
<br>
THERE... ARE... PITS... EEVVEERRYYWWHHEERREE!!!!  Everywhere.<br>
<br>
Basically, you spend the whole game falling into pits looking for phone
parts. But they're never there, so then you have to float back up out
of the pit. This in itself is a laborous and annoying process.
Basically, you hold the fire button and the joystick up, and ET's neck
expands and he begins to float up out of the pit. Once you hit the top,
the screen switches back to the pit-filled "overworld." But then, if
you didn't let go of the joystick fast enough, he'd fall back into the
same pit due to awful collision detection.<br>
<br>
So, I've tried to explain the game best I can. And yeah, it sucks
basically. Of course, even if you could get the phone parts easy at
all, there are plenty more tricks to kill ET. First off, he has a
limited amount of life shown at the bottom of the screen as a number.
Everytime you move, float, fall, whatever, it used up life.<br>
<br>
THEN there were these scientists out to get ET. They're faster than
you, so they can capture you pretty easy and throw you into jail.
Thankfully however, the jail is so poorly constructed that you can just
walk out.<br>
<br>
I don't really feel like describing the rest of the game (graphics, sound, etc), but trust me: it's just as bad.
