I'm not really a big fan of hockey games, or even sports games in
general. However, I've been much more drawn to 8-bit sports games such
as Tennis, Tecmo Bowl, and Ice Hockey. There's NHL 07 and NHL 2k7 and
all that good stuff, but Ice Hockey makes for a good, 8-bit,
arcade-style game of hockey.<br>
<br>
The premise of the game is still ice hockey: you command a four-man
team of players, shootin' the puck into the goal and ice hockey stuff
like that. But what makes this game unique is it's simple-but-deep team
customization system.<br>
<br>
You have four men on your team; each can be one of three body types,
skinny, average, or heavy (aka fat). Each of the three builds has
specific strengths and weaknesses: skinny players are very fast and
maneuverable, although their shots are weaker. Heavy / fat players are
slow powerhouses. Average players are in between, with average speed
and shooting.<br>
<br>
The default configuration is Fat / Avg / Avg / Skinny (which works
pretty well), but since you can change around your lineup of players,
it gives the game a surprising amount of depth and replay value. I've
actually found that the "four fatties" make for a pretty good team. The
large players absolutely slaughter the defense with their mad checking
skills, and they've got mad shooting skills to boot. That's not to say
the other two types are just straight up useless, though.<br>
<br>
The game itself is basically... hockey. A very FAST game of hockey.
Very fast. When I first picked up the game, it took me a while to get
used to the pacing of the game. You control one player at a time, and
can switch between them if the opposing team is on offense. When you
hit the switching button your control shifts to whoever is closest to
the puck, which isn't always clear. You get used to the pacing of the
game after a while though, and you realize it couldn't be played any
slower.<br>
<br>
The control itself is very tight. Two buttons is all you need for this
game, on offense or defense. On offense there's just shoot and pass,
and on defense a button to switch players and one to steal the puck.
You basically mash on the A button to steal the puck (if you have a
human opponent, they should be too). If the skirmish lasts for more
than a couple second, a field-wide fight breaks out, with the other six
players on both teams jumping into your fight. A little comic "fight
cloud" forms around them until the ref jumps in and breaks up the
fight. Then someone is sent to the penalty box for a while.<br>
<br>
Controlling the goalie is one of the more unorthadox parts of the game.
The goalie is basically always in your control, moving around his
little box. He's only controlled with the D-Pad, but since you command
him and your own player while on defense, you have to shift your
priorities to either actively controlling the goalie to stop a puck, or
actively controlling a defensive player to steal the puck and shift to
offense.<br>
<br>
The game can be played in one- or two-player games of three quarters,
seven, ten, or fifteen minutes each. The one player mode is pretty
good, with a fairly challenging AI, albeit an AI you learn to trounce
easily after about your third or fourth game. But the 2-player mode is
an absolute blast, and definetly one of the best multiplayer
experiences on the NES, if not just one of the best simultaneous
multiplayer sports games for the system. In short, it's a lot of fun to
play with a friend.<br>
<br>
Graphically, the game holds up well. The players animate well, although
they're presented in a much more cartoony, comical style than some
gritty "realstic" 8-bit graphics, like NES games used to try and have
back in the day.<br>
<br>
The games soundtrack consists of four main tunes, one of which you
memorize quickly, which is the game's main theme. One song plays
continuously during gameplay, although it's not one that every gets old
or annoying or anything. The sound effects are your basic skating,
shooting, fighting, referee-whistling kind of stuff, which is great.<br>
<br>
In short, if you're into NES sports, you'll definetly like this game.
This coming from someone who isn't really much into sports games in the
least.
