	Here is where I keep all the various games I create.  They're all made by me (unless otherwise noted), and so are my property.  
	Feel free to distribute them to your friends or whatever, as they are freeware, but don't host them on the 
	internet, just link to my site if you want to show someone.  All of the games are freeware and none include
	any spyware or adware or even require installation to play.  Thanks, and enjoy!
