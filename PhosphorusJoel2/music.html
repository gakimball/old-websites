				<b>.a nerd monologue.</b><br>
				this song is about a very special person... except, we
				can't tell you who it is, or we would be compromised.<br>

				<b>.power gloves return.</b><br>
				can a song have a sequel?  if they can't, I guess we
				broke the rules.  so who wrote these rules again?<br>

				this guy lost his socks, so he's going to tell
				you all about it.<br>

				<b><a href="powergloves.html" class="black">.power gloves unite.</a></b><br>
				an instrumental song that, being instrumental, isn't
				really about anything whatsoever.<br>

				<b><a href="thegao.html" class="black">.the gao.</a></b><br>
				the first ever phosphorus joel song.  revisit our
				dark past by listening to this song.  we actually thought
