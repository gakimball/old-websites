				<span style="font-size: small;">
				the story of phosphorus joel is a complicated one... well, not
				really.  a couple people thought making a band was a good idea.  only
				problem was only two of the five people could actually make music
				of any kind.<br>
				<br>
				nowadays, in the future, in the cyberworld, there are three people
				that occupy the phosphorus joel, uh, seats.  their names are drew,
				geoff, and brian.  drew plays the guitar, brian plays the bass, and
				geoff plays the... writes the words to the songs, and then says them.<br>
				<br>
				we try and make people laugh when we write music.  maybe you'll laugh
				when you hear our music... provided you play video games, or have attended
				a geekfest such as comicon.<br>
				<br>
				there's some music here, and more on our myspace page, purevolume page,
				mp3.com page, or even our last.fm page maybe.  yeah, we're pretty
				much everywhere.  so go tell someone about us if you like our music, and
				maybe they will too.  you can never have too many myspace friends that
				are all bands, anyway.<br>
				<br>
				maybe one day we'll be a super mega ultra zomgowned band... like simple
				plan.  or uh, the backstreet <s>boyz</s> boys.
