				power gloves unite is an instrumental song, full
				of "that roaring guitar feel" and garage band loops
				for a full three minutes.  get your funk on with
				this groovatronic songtacular song*<br>
				<br>
				*song not guarenteed to be funky, groovatronic, or
				songtacular.... :(<br>
				<br>
				so how ugly is the color scheme for THIS page?  just
				<a href="http://google.com">download the song</a> so you can get out of here.<br>
				<br>
				and watch out for the epic sequel, power gloves return!  get
				it?  they're uh... returning?  who are the power gloves anyway?
				or maybe a better question is WHAT are the power gloves anyway?
				busted nes peripheral, or deadly enemy?  you know, the power
				gloves... they have a secret headquarters in los angeles, and
				they're run by the gang leader pepsiman.<br>
				<br>
				pepsiman... pepsi-themed superhero by day, evil dude person
				kinda person by night.<br>
