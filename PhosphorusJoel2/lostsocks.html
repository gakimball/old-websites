				<span style="font-size: small;">
				lost my socks is an emotional, depressing song about
				some freak who lost his socks to three aliens that all
				look like tom cruise.<br>
				<br>
				the deep lyrics of this song contain many myseries within: who
				are these aliens?  where do they come from?  why do they
				want this toenail-clipping man's socks?  and WHY do they look
				like tom cruise "with his face melted off?"<br>
				<br>
				ponder these questions as you listen to the epic
				lost my socks trilogy.  they're all a little different,
				but uh, pretty much the same either way.  just download
				them okay?  the guitar is pretty cool.<br>
