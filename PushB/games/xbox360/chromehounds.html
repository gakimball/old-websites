		<b>I have just come back from</b> Neroimus War #12, a successful survivor of
		the Sal Kar Nation, winner of the 12th campaign. I'm here looking for
		more recruits, The Tarakians are retaliating, and have already taken
		our headquarters, here in War #13.<br>
		<br>
		We are currently accepting all applicants regardless of skill or
		prior Hound combat training, we'll teach you the basics, after that,
		there's little we can do for you. We are looking for pilots of all six
		Role Types, Soldiers, Scouts, Defenders, Snipers, Artillery Gunners,
		and if you're up for it, we might even recommend you for Commanding
		Officer.<br>
		<br>We'll give you enough cash to customize your own hound from
		hundreds of legs, cockpits, generators, light and heavy arms, even air
		lift rotors. Hell, we'll even give you your first Hound free. If that's
		not enough for you, we offer rewards for successful completion of each
		of 42 training missions, and a special bonus part for mastering each of
		them.<br>
		<br>Remember, Sal Kar is the richest of all the nations, and we
		know the value of cheap, lightweight equipment. Our hounds can run
		circles around the Tarakian and Morskoj hounds, and our scouts are the
		best known to man. Just be careful for their heavy armor, and keep
		firing, they won't go down in a few hits like some of our unfortunate
		soldiers are right now.<br>
		<br>Once you have your hound assembled, you need to join a squad
		before going to the campaign frontlines. Feel free to join the Maleus
		Malifica, my unit. Named after an infamous book of the crusades,
		designed to help you find and deal with heretics. Or if you desire, you
		can form your own squad.<br>
		<br>If you ever see me on the battlefield, you'll know it by the
		Hound I drive. It's been nicknamed the "Gouda Snake". Snake because its
		treads and vertically stacked design makes it look and act like a
		coiled viper ready to strike. Gouda? Let's just say, it's cheesy. Armed
		with a plethora of guided rockets, I don't plan to miss anytime soon,
		and being hammered by all those explosives really rocks the receiver so
		they can't shoot straight back... good thing, my cockpit is about the
		easiest thing to hit on my hound.<br>
		<br>Another of our favorite Hound Designs -- The Pile Driver.
		Remember I said we were the fastest Hounds out there? What better way
		to put speed to use than with Piles, huge thick spikes mounted on a
		battering ram arm that can rip though the toughest armor very quickly.<br>
		<br>If you've been disappointed by Mech 'games' before, have no
		fear, this one is very playable, offers you a great amount of
		customizability, and has the absolute best 'campaign' ever -- a real
		time war! A word of warning -- the Hound you use to crush the A.I. may
		do very poorly against human opponents. Good luck recruit!	</td></tr>
