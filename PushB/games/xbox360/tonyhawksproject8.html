		<b>Tony Hawk appeared on the Xbox 360</b> last year, but Tony Hawk's Project 8
		marks the first time that the series has been built from the ground up
		for the current generation of consoles. As you might expect, not being
		saddled with the constraints of the Xbox and PlayStation 2, Activision
		and Neversoft have made some strong visual strides this year, updating
		and modernizing the game's look while replacing a lot of the trick
		animations that had been in place for years. The gameplay is as
		freeform and as technical as it's ever been, with some smart changes on
		that front that are enough to keep fans of the series interested, while
		a new tutorial is aimed at getting new players up to speed.
		Unfortunately, some technical glitches and unstable frame rates plague
		both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 version of the game.<br>
		<br>
		Those frame-rate problems hit the PlayStation 3 version of the game
		significantly harder than the Xbox 360. Other than the choppy frame
		rate and slightly sharper graphics on the PlayStation 3, some of which
		is only noticeable when using an HDMI cable on a high-end HDTV, the
		games look roughly the same. But there are other, more significant
		differences between the two versions. The Xbox 360 version has online
		support for up to eight players, including a new game mode called
		walls, which gives your skater a tall trail behind him that behaves
		sort of like the light cycles in Tron--if you hit another player's
		wall, you're out. The Xbox 360 version also uses its online support to
		present a lot of different online leaderboards. Much like Amped 3, many
		of the different goals in the game have their own individual
		leaderboard, which adds some competition to the single-player game and
		gives you a reason to keep on playing the same goals again and again.
		Without this, the PS3 version feels sort of flat by comparison.<br>
		<br>
		The PlayStation 3 version of the game distinguishes itself by offering
		complete support for the Sixaxis controller's motion-sensing abilities.
		You can set it to just control functions like balancing, if you like,
		or you can move and execute tricks with it, as well. It works, but it
		lacks the precision offered by the D pad, so it's a neat experiment
		that's pretty good at showing off what the Sixaxis is capable of, but
		you probably wouldn't want to play through the game this way. The
		PlayStation 3 version also installs a 264MB cache file onto the
		system's hard drive when you first put the game in your system.
		Presumably, this is done to help speed up loading, but the load times
		don't seem much better than the Xbox 360 version of the game. If you're
		in a position where you have to choose between the two versions of the
		game, the Xbox 360 version offers a more complete package. The Tony
		Hawk series was a pioneer when it came to being online on the
		PlayStation 2, and its omission on the PS3 is completely crazy and
		thoroughly disappointing.
