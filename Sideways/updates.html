<b>May 30, 2007 - Even more songs?</b>
<br>
Three men enter.  And suddenly two new songs appeared.
Funny how that works out.  Scroll to the right to see
them, and maybe even download them perhaps.  They
are: Halo Player, and Power Gloves Return.  Download
them instantly through the internet.
<br><br>
<b>May 28, 2007 - Frets on Fire</b>
<br>
Here's something for the kids out there - if you
have Frets on Fire (a PC clone of the most awesome
game Guitar Hero), you too can play along with the
Phosphorus Joel dudes... maybe.  We've turned
the smash jam summer #1 hit Lost My Socks into a
playable FoF song.  It's in the Music section of
the site (to the right of here) on the song's
page.
<br><br>
<b>May 27, 2007 - Songs about people</b>
<br>
This new song is about a very special person.  But
we can't tell you who, or we would be compromised.
The song is entitled A Nerd Monologue.  Download
it to the right as always, and let it enter your
ears.
