Phosphorus Joel has been making music from someone's
house for a while.  At least a couple months.  We were
formed in a shop somewhere in Washington, DC.  I
think they sold some of those sweet bumper stickers that
say like, I dunno, on them.<br>
<br>
There are three of us in the band.  One of us actually
knows how to play guitar, one maybe plays bass, and one
of us writes and says the words to the songs.  We is:<br>
<br>
<b>Drew</b> - Guitar<br>
<b>Brian</b> - Bass<br>
<b>Geoff</b> - Words<br>
<br>
Drums are brought to you by the keyboard I have around
the house.  It does mad MIDIs.  So go and download our
music, or go to our Myspace.  Because come on, you can't
have too many Myspace friends that are all bands.
